# World 2.0

We're creating a virtual society. A triangular one. People have three distinct views, specifically in regards to technology. Pro-technology, anti-technology and moderates. Well, to be frank, the anti and pro tech population are more of extremists. Let's dive in into what this entails.

## TODOs
### Geographies
* A triangle planet (visualisation & locations)
* Countries - The population have different characteristics depending on location. 
* Cities - Nodes for people to live together and enjoy life.
* Cultural - 3 different cultures on each peak of the triangle. Technological extremists, anti-tech and the moderates. 

### People
* Names
* Date of birth
* Country of origin 
* Country of residence
* Faces - Generated with AI
* Personalities - The basic coffee-chat topics. However more conversational in terms of their views on technology.
